             <h4>What is Technology?</h4>
             <br>
             	<p>The role and influence of technology in both our personal and professional lives is expanding all the time. Understanding how people frame technology and how technology contours people's interactions with one another and with the natural world is crucial not only for those who research, develop, and foster innovation, but also for all the individuals and organizations who must use those technologies in their professional and personal lives. Technology is about taking action to meet a human need rather than simply understanding how the natural world works, which is the goal of science. The invention of the microscope was motivated by a desire to explore the world of the small, which was beyond the scope of our unaided vision. This technological solution to a long-standing problem has allowed us to better understand the workings of the world, which has led to the development of new technologies.</p>

             <h4>Technology And Human Life</h4>
             <br>
             	<p>Innumerable ways, modern technology has altered our lives, revolutionizing how we work, live, and play. In 1989, only 15% of households had a personal computer, according to the Census Bureau. By 2011, that figure had risen to 75 percent. Given the ubiquity of emails, unified communications, smartphones, and laptops, modern offices would be barely recognizable to workers from the past. Communication is one of the areas where innovation has had the greatest impact. Computers can store massive amounts of data in a very small amount of space, reducing shelves of reference books to a single flash drive.</p>

             <h4>Technology and Society: How Technology Changed Our Lives</h4>
             <br>
             	<p>Technological innovations, inventions, and engineering applications used within societies to carry out tasks have both aided and hampered ancient and modern human civilizations. Technological advancements have become essential for societies to thrive and evolve, while human societies' culture, ideals, and aspirations have sculpted how those civilizations have generated, benefited from, and been hampered by technology. <br>Human societies/civilizations and their technology have become inseparable as technological systems are invented by humans and portray the very core of a population's necessities and heritage.</p>
